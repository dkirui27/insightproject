Standing biceps stretch,Biceps,Arms,"Stand tall, feet shoulder-distance apart, knees slightly bent. With your arms extended, clasp your hands directly behind your back, palms touching.
From this position, rotate your wrists backward, opening your still-clasped hands so your palms are facing the ground.
Keeping your elbows straight, raise your arms behind your body until you feel a stretch through your biceps. Hold for 20 to 30 seconds, release, and repeat. To get a deeper stretch through your shoulders and chest, look up toward the ceiling and draw your shoulders backward to broaden your chest."
Alternating wrist pull,Forearms,Arms,"From a seated or standing position, extend both arms directly in front of your chest. Flex your left wrist toward you, so your fingers point upward, then rotate it to the outside until your fingers point toward the floor.

Cross-body shoulder stretch,Shoulders,Arms,"Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, both arms extended down at your sides.

"Cat, cow, child's pose sequence",Back,Back,"Start on your hands and knees on an exercise mat, your palms positioned under your shoulders, your knees positioned under your hips, and your back and neck in a flat (neutral) position.
Enter cow pose as you inhale by looking up and stretching your chest forward as you simultaneously press your hips upward, trying to articulate your tailbone toward the ceiling. This action will cause your low back to dip toward the floor, stretching your abs in the process. Hold for a count of three.
Enter cat pose as you exhale by lowering your head between your shoulders and tucking your tailbone under, scooping your hips forward and pressing your upper back and shoulders toward the ceiling. Round your shoulders outward to broaden the stretch across your upper back. Use your abs to keep your hips scooped forward to feel a nice stretch through your low back and hips. Hold for a count of three.
Return to a neutral, tabletop-like position on your next inhale, then as you exhale, enter child's pose by sitting back on your heels, your chest folding over your quads as you reach your arms as far as you can over your head, your palms flat on the ground. Hold this position for three deep breaths, really sinking your hips into your heels with each exhale.
After three breaths, return to the tabletop position and perform three to five more rounds of the sequence."
Wall-assisted single-arm chest stretch,Chest,Upper Body,"Stand with your left side perpendicular to a wall, about 1 to 2ft away from the wall.
Reach your left arm behind you, your elbow extended, and place your left palm flat on the wall. Start with your hand positioned so your left arm is parallel to the floor.
You should feel a stretch through your chest and the front of your shoulder. To deepen the stretch, shift your weight toward the wall, or slowly move your feet closer to the wall. When you feel a good stretch, hold the position for 20 to 30 seconds before switching sides.
You can change the angle of the stretch by positioning your palm higher or lower on the wall."

Slowly step forward as you simultaneously lean back, lying down on top of the ball.
With your knees still bent, extend your arms over your head and reach them backward, allowing your back to arch with the support of the ball. You should feel a good stretch through your abs, chest, and shoulders.
Continue reaching backward as far as you can, and if you feel comfortable, step your feet forward, extending your knees to enjoy a stretch through your quads and hip flexors.
Hold the supported backbend for 30 to 60 seconds, breathing deeply throughout."
Supine figure-4 glute stretch,Glutes,Lower Body,"Lie on your back, your knees bent, feet flat on the floor. Cross your right ankle over your left knee, as if creating a ""4"" with your legs.

From this position, use your arms to pull your left leg closer to your body to deepen the stretch. Keep your right knee pointed toward the side of the room -- don't let it adduct toward your midline.
